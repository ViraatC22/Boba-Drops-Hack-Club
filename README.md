## 🚀 How to Run

Since this project uses modern ES6 modules, it requires a local web server to run properly.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ViraatC22/Boba-Drops-Hack-Club.git
    cd Boba-Drops-Hack-Club

2.  **Start a local server:**
    
    If you have Python installed (Mac/Linux/Windows):

    ```
    
    Or if you have Node.js installed:
    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in your terminal) to view the website.
